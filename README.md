# Project-Customer-In-app-Behavior-Analysis-
Customer_to_Subscription_through_app_behavior

In this project, I worked on financial application data and predicted whether the customer would take a premium version app subscription or not. Then the company will take actions on the customers to give the offers or not. The data contains the customer’s behavior and our job is to find insights from it. 

Tools: To complete this project, use Python programming and its libraries NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

The Financial Technology company (Fin-Tech Company) launched a mobile app. This app is used for financial purposes like bank loans, savings, etc. in one place. It has two versions free and premium. The free version app contains basic features and if the customer wants to use the premium feature then they have to pay some amount to unlock it.
The main goal of the company is to sell the premium version app with low advertisement cost but they don’t know how to do it. That’s a reason they are provided the premium feature in the free version app for 24 hours to collect the customer’s behavior. After that, the company hired a Machine Learning Engineer to find insight from the collected data (customer behavior).

Scope: The job of the ML engineer is to find or predict whether a new customer is interested in buying the product or not. If the customers will buy a product anyway so no need to give an offer to that customer and lose the business. Only give offers to those customers who are interested in using the premium version app, but can’t afford its cost. So the company will give offers to those customers and earn more money.
